## Important Note for Fork-Based PRs

If you're submitting a PR from a forked repository, please note that E2E tests require specific repository-level environment (`integration`) and secrets to be set up. These are described in `.env.example` and include:

```bash
PUBLIC_ENV_NAME=integration
SUPABASE_URL=###
SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY=###

E2E_USERNAME_ID=###
E2E_USERNAME=###
E2E_PASSWORD=###
```

Please ensure these are properly configured in your fork's repository settings under "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions" before running E2E tests.
